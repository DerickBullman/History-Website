      <h2> First Jet Plane </h2>
      <div class="picture">
        <p> De Havilland Comet, The first jet powered airliner, created by a british engineer it would travel over 104.6 million miles and carry 28,000 passengers along with copious amounts of mail. However its fame would fall quickly as design flaws revolving around pressurization, metal fatigue and window construction. Even for those flaws it sped up transport from around the world and opened it to commercial jets.

      <h2> Jumbo Jet </h2>
      <div class="picture">
        <p> Boeing 747 Beginning as a military contract for a massive transport plane the 747 would fail in that role, however in its 28 month design period, as apposed to the normal 42 month time frame in would turn into a commercial airliner. After years of redesigning it would truly shrink the world. And its most famous variant the 747-400 would have a maximum range of 7,670 miles capable of going around 1/3 of the world on a single tank. Now many 747 have been converted to freight allowing easy transport of mail ad products making communication cheaper, and quicker.
